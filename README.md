## How to view

Thanks for checking out my work! I did my best to match the given mock up and hope the result is what you all were looking for.

### Write Up 

  1. Technologies I used: 
    * I decided to stick to a basic tech stack as I wanted to keep the site simple yet clean instead of making things more dificult than need be. I used bootstrap to help implement a grid system and use some of their components. 
  2. Struggles I faced when developing with this tech stack: 
    * I struggled in the begging with deciding what technology I should use. I wanted to show off all of my skills but also did not want to over complicate things which is why I ultimately decided to keep it simple. But as keeping it simple I strugled with modularizing my code and would like to go back and do it all using something like SASS. Due to a unexpected busy work I wasn't able to implement all the ideas. 
  3. What I enjoyed most about the task: 
    * Loved diving into designing out the website to make it look just like the mock up.
